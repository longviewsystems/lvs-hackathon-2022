# Setup Free Azure Account

Microsoft provides a [$200 (USD) credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/free/) that can be used for virtually any Azure Service. The credit is good for 30-days. After you set it up, you&#39;ll want to monitor the free accountant using [Azure Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/cost-management/) to make sure the credit does not run out.

In addition to the $200 credit, there are dozens of free services. The free trial lasts for a year, and there are dozens of services with a free tier. See the list of services on [this page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/free/).

**MAJOR REQUIREMENT #1:** You need to supply a valid credit card. Prepaid credit cards won&#39;t work. There is no charge involved with the setting up of a trial account. Microsoft uses the card to verify your identity.

**MAJOR REQUIREMENT #2:** You must verify using a cell phone. SMS messages are fairly easy to use in this case, but the phone number must be real.

See the [free account FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/free/free-account-faq/) for more details.

# How to set it up

1. Create an email address that has not used the trial before.
    * outlook.com or gmail.com addresses work.
    * **LVS1.com addresses will not work.**
2. Go through the sign-up process.
    * The required details vary depending on the options selected, and if you've used the account with other Microsoft services.
3. Login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to start using Azure.
    * This is a normal Azure subscription with a tenant. You can add individual user IDs, and setup resources like a normal environment although the budget is limited to $200 USD.
