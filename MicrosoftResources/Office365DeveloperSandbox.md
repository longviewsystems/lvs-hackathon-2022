# Overview

Get a new instant sandbox preconfigured with sample data, including Teams Developer Portal, and start developing on the Microsoft 365 platform. The new environment is production ready and setup very quickly, but it only lasts for 90 days, and then it resets so it's not appropriate for longterm use.
