# Microsoft Resources
## Free Azure Account
Microsoft provides a $200 (USD) credit that can be used for virtually any Azure Service.  The credit is good for 30-days.  After you set it up, you’ll want to monitor the free accountant using Azure Cost Management to make sure the credit does not run out. 

[Further information](./MicrosoftResources/AzureSubscription.md)

## Office 365 Developer Sandbox
Get a new instant sandbox preconfigured with sample data, including Teams Developer Portal, and start developing on the Microsoft 365 platform.  It’s production ready and setup very quickly, but it only lasts for 90 days, and then it resets so it’s not appropriate for customer use.
