|  Doing more with Webex | Beginner | To start off, let's try creating a workflow to integrate Webex with another application! Try using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/explore), [Make](https://apphub.webex.com/applications/make-make), or [Power Automate](https://apphub.webex.com/applications/microsoft-power-automate-for-webex-cisco-systems-61111) to do this. Feel free to create anything! |
|  [Orchestrating with SecureX Introduction](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/SecureX-orchestration/Cisco-SecureX-intro-lab/step/1 [Orchestrating with SecureX Hands-on](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/SecureX-orchestration/Cisco-SecureX-101-lab/step/1)
| Intermediate | In this module, you will learn about orchestration within SecureX – an integrated and open platform that connects Cisco’s Secure portfolio. SecureX orchestration is an automation and orchestration platform that uses a no-to-low code approach to deliver high-performance, scalable process automation. Using this platform, we can simplify investigation and data collection, automate repetitive tasks, integrate disparate systems, and more. Orchestration within SecureX works closely with many of Cisco’s products as well as products from third parties. **Note:** The lab link has been updated as of Apr 21. |
